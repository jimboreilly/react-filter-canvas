# react-filter-canvas
In the past, I had done a lot of image processing code using various filters in C++ and C#. Thinking about how DOM manipulation works (or doesn't) in React, I thought it would be interesting to try some of the same pixel calculations.


right now the filtered image `onClick` is the hack to do a filter... WIP
